notes:
  - >
    Main board does not seem to have an easily accessible pinout,
    would need to use debugging pins at the bottom power unit.
  - >
    When booted, it checks for an X-loader on mmc-0 twice. It uses a
    Texas Instruments X-loader v1.51. When boot fail, it boots from the eMMC
    and loads mmc-1, where it succeeds. 
  - > 
    Gets straight into U-Boot without any obvious way of interrupting it

    Disk image provided in the external source is running Debian 8. Located in
    the last partition. To my naked eye, seems like a fresh install partitioned
    according to Ti's specifications, if the source is to be believed.
