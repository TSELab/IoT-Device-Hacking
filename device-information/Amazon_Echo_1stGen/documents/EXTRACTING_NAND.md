# Extracting and Flashing the NAND flash on the Amazon Echo 1st Gen
Written by Alan Chung Ma, last updated May 17, 2022.

## Procedure
1. Looking to desolder the SanDisk SDIN7DP2-4G (the NAND flash), no experience in such type of desoldering, so will attempt to desolder the Micron D9RWH (RAM). If successful, will move forward with the NAND flash.
2. Successfully removed RAM, will attempt to extract the NAND now, will take more time than I thought, need to be more patient.
3. I successfully removed the NAND; however, it was not as clean as I'd have hoped. A lot of cleaning was made and I think I removed a lot of extra stuff. Not enough flux got into the contacts and a bunch of it was half snaped off. I hope it still works.
4. Will need to wait until later since it uses full-size SD slot and my laptop does not have one.
